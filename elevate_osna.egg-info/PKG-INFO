        ### Using this repository
        
        - At the start of the course, students will be divided into project teams. Each team will receive a copy of this starter code in a new repository. E.g.:
        https://github.com/tapilab/elevate-osna-team1
        - Each team member will then clone their team repository to their personal computer to work on their project. E.g.: `git clone https://github.com/tapilab/elevate-osna-team1.git`
        - Tasks will be assigned to each team, who will then check in their code to their team repository. 
        - Before beginning work each day, run the `update.sh` command to pull the latest code from the `elevate-osna-starter` repository to your team's repository.
