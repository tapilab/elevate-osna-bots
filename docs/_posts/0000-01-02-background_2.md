We list some typical characteristics of bots on Twitter:

* The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content.

* The accountâ€™s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve.

* The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers.

* Many bots tweet the same content as other users at roughly the same time. 

* Short replies to other tweets can also indicate automated behavior.

* There is often no biography, or indeed a photo, associated with bot Twitter accounts.
