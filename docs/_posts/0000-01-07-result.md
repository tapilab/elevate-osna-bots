Notes:
1. **ngram (min_n, max_n)**: an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a sentence. Here all n- grams with lower boundary min_n and upper boundary max_n will be extracted.
2. **min_df**: when building the vocabulary, we ignore terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. Correspondingly, there is a parameter named max_df which is used to ignore terms with high frequency.
