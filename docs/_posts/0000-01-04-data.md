Our training data size:

|          | Count    |
|----------|----------|
| Bot      | 8841     |
| Human    | 4585     |
| Total    | 13426    |

We considered three classifiers: 

1. Firstly, we extracted a few features with our data and used the Logistic Regression classifier to fit the model. 

2. Then we calculated the accuracy with cross-validation and compared the accuracy with two additional classifiers: Multi-layer Perceptron and Random Forest. 

3. Finally, we decided to use Logistic Regression because of its outstanding performance.
